## React and Tech Stack

#### `npx create-react-app tik-tok-in-react`

#### `npm install react-ticker`

a react library that functions similar to HTML's `<marqee>`

#### `npm install firebase`

## Material UI https://material-ui.com/

#### `npm install @material-ui/core`

In a nutshell, Material-UI is an open-source project that features React components that implement Google's Material Design. ... With over 35,000 stars on GitHub, Material-UI is one of the top user interface libraries for React out there.

#### `npm install @material-ui/icons`

1100+ React Material icons ready to use from the official website

## CSS

#### `Hacks and flexbox`

learned some great stuff from the pros on this build but dam I have made a sweet layout based on the samsung s10+, really love the result and pretty simple css to do it

this was a great build to start to understand React with Hooks useState useRef useEffect ect...

## Next Steps

I'm moving onto React Native app development and will look into replicating this project or something similar specifically to develop an Android/ios app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
